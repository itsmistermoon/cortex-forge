# Context

Domain vocabulary for this repo and its sibling suite (Kuyen, `almagest-kuyen`). See `docs/adr/` for the decisions behind these terms.

## Glossary (family)

- **Almagest** — the umbrella ("casa madre") for the two vault suites: Antu (full) and Kuyen (lite). Canonical definition and `family-conventions.md` live in the `almagest` repo; suite repos are `almagest-antu` and `almagest-kuyen`. The brand appears once as context, never as a prefix on skill names.
- **`kyn-` prefix** — Kuyen's installed skill names (`kyn-hot-handoff`, `kyn-wiki-ingest`, `kyn-wiki-query`, `kyn-wiki-lint`) carry this abbreviated brand prefix because both suites install flat into the same global skills directory and skills.sh has no cross-source namespacing — identical names would silently overwrite (ADR 0004, decision 6). Antu owns the clean domain-prefixed names.
- **`~/.almagest/`** — the shared global config directory (renamed from `~/.cortex-forge/`). Antu uses its full multi-vault registry; Kuyen may read exactly one thing from it: the default vault's path (ADR 0004, decision 4).

## Glossary (suite)

- **`.hot/`** — the per-vault session-state directory, shared by Antu and Kuyen. Named for its role (a fast, always-loaded cache), not for any single file or skill inside it. Never committed to git.
- **`HANDOFF.md`** — the current session snapshot inside `.hot/`, written by `/hot-handoff` or `/kuyen-handoff`. Replaces the old `MEMORY.md` name.
- **`HISTORY.md`** — the append-only archive inside `.hot/` that past `HANDOFF.md` content rotates or dumps into. Replaces the old `CONSOLIDATED.md` name.
- **`PLAYBOOK.md`** — Antu-only durable operational knowledge (workarounds, conventions, recurring failure patterns) inside `.hot/`, distinct from the session-scoped `HANDOFF.md`. Kuyen has no equivalent and never touches this file. Replaces the old `PRAXIS.md` name.
- **`suite:` marker** — a single frontmatter key (`suite: antu` / `suite: kuyen`) at the top of `HANDOFF.md`, identifying which suite wrote it last. Lets either skill detect foreign-format content without parsing the rest of the file.
- **`hot-triage`** — Antu-only, on-demand skill for `.hot/` hygiene: recovering pending/fragile-context items buried in `HISTORY.md` after a cross-suite write, re-evaluating `### Pending`/`### Active decisions` validity, retrospective `PLAYBOOK.md` candidate review, and deeper `HISTORY.md` cleanup. Mirrors `wiki-lint`'s pattern (separate hygiene skill vs. folding into a skill that runs every session). No Kuyen equivalent.
- **OKF (Open Knowledge Format)** — external, vendor-neutral spec ([GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf)) for representing knowledge as a bundle of markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`type` required; `index.md`/`log.md` reserved; relationships via markdown links). Antu adopts it wholesale as the format for `wiki/` (ADR 0005), replacing the suite's own improvised conventions where they overlap. `.hot/` artifacts (`HANDOFF.md`/`HISTORY.md`/`PLAYBOOK.md`) are a separate, conditional evaluation, not guaranteed adoption. ADR 0005's decisions are written portably (about the format itself, not Antu-only implementation details) because Kuyen is expected to adopt them later in a cascade — Kuyen's own adoption is a separate, future effort in `almagest-kuyen`, out of scope for ADR 0005.
